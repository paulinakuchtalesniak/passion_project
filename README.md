# Passion Project: Procedural Design and Generative Typography

## Research Question
**How can procedural design combine typographic rules with artistic freedom to create generative fonts with visual impact?**

## About the Project
This project explores the intersection of typography and procedural design, aiming to create tools that blend the structured rules of typography with the expressive possibilities of generative art. The primary goal is to develop a system for designing generative fonts and compositions that are both visually striking and rooted in typographic principles.

The project is part of my **Passion Project**, It seeks to answer how procedural methods can offer a balance between precision and creative exploration.

## Core Objectives
1. **Integrate Typographic Rules**: Maintain typographic structure and legibility while exploring abstraction.
2. **Enable Artistic Freedom**: Provide users with tools to experiment with randomness, distortion, and other generative techniques.
3. **Focus on Visual Impact**: Create outputs that are bold, unique, and aesthetically engaging.
4. **Develop Generative Fonts**: Use procedural methods to create and manipulate custom typefaces.
5. **Offer Exportable Outputs**: Allow users to save their designs for further use in digital and print projects.


### Planned Developments
- Procedural font generation using customizable rules.
- Advanced controls for combining typographic grids with artistic distortion.
- Improved UI for intuitive experimentation.
- Integration of p5.js for potential web-based versions.

## Phases of Development
1. **Research**: Understanding typographic rules, grid systems, and generative art techniques.
2. **Tool Development**: Building a generative art tool using Processing.
3. **Iterative Experimentation**: Testing and refining tools to balance artistic freedom with typographic constraints.
4. **Finalization**: Producing a polished tool, accompanied by documentation, video showcases, and a jury presentation.

## How to Use the Tool (Current Demo)
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
